# Meme_Stock_Crawler
This was a side project that I started when the GME stock surge happened. It crawls reddit using the PRAW and Pushift API to scrape subreddits and plot the frequency of certain stock tickers. The plot shows the mention of GME preceeding the stock surge. Stocknames were referenced from the nasdaq traded list.
